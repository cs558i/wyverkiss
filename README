Wyverkiss is an alternative rootfs for KISS Linux. If KISS goes GNU, we
go the opposite.

Wyverkiss (unlike Wyvertux) is supposed to closely track KISS Linux as
much as possible. It means the Wyverkiss repo will only be used as an
"overlay" for KISS Linux to work outside the GNU toolchain ecosystem
(except for a select few programs that will be needed). The changes made
in Wyverkiss will be upstreamed if possible.

Ideally, this repository should be almost empty or unneeded at all. But
that would be highly unrealistic.

Changes:
- The GCC suite (gcc, libstdc++, libgcc, etc.) will be replaced by the
  LLVM suite (clang, libc++, compiler-rt, etc.)
- binutils will be replaced with its LLVM counterpart (except GNU as,
  which will be packaged separately)
- bison will be replaced with byacc (patching might be needed for a few
  packages)
- gzip will be replaced with pigz
- GNU make will be replaced with bmake, but the former will be available
  as it's absolutely needed by some packages. It will use the gmake name.
- ncurses will be replaced by netbsd-curses, thanks to Sabotage Linux.

NOTE: Wyverkiss might or will NOT be officially supported by KISS Linux.
      As always, use at your own risk. Support for certain packages
      might not be guaranteed.
