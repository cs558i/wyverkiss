Wyverkiss is an alternative rootfs for KISS Linux. If KISS goes GNU, we
go the opposite.

Wyverkiss (unlike Wyvertux) is supposed to closely track KISS Linux as
much as possible. It means the Wyverkiss repo will only be used as an
"overlay" for KISS Linux to work outside the GNU toolchain ecosystem
(except for a select few programs that will be needed). The changes made
in Wyverkiss will be upstreamed if possible.

Ideally, this repository should be almost empty or unneeded at all. But
that would be highly unrealistic.
